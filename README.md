# ParkingLot System

This Java project implements a car parking system that can accommodate different types of vehicles and supports a configurable cost strategy. It allows you to initialize a parking lot with a given number of floors and car spaces per floor, add vehicle details, remove vehicles, and check the availability of vehicle spaces.


## Features

- Initialize the parking lot with a given number of floors and car spaces per floor.
- Add vehicle details to the parking lot, including the vehicle type, registration number, and color.
- Remove a vehicle from the parking lot based on the registration number or parking slot number.
- Check the availability of vehicle spaces on a specific floor for a given vehicle type.



## Usage
1. Initialize the parking lot with the ParkingLot constructor, specifying the total number of floors and car spaces per floor.

2. Use the "addVehicle" method to add vehicle to the parking lot.

## Cost Strategy

The cost strategy is implemented as a flat cost structure based on the vehicle type per hour:
