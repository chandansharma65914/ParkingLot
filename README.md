# ParkingLot System

This Java project implements a car parking system that can accommodate different types of vehicles and supports a configurable cost strategy. It allows you to initialize a parking lot with a given number of floors and car spaces per floor, add vehicle details, remove vehicles, and check the availability of vehicle spaces.


## Features

- Initialize the parking lot with a given number of floors and car spaces per floor.
- Add vehicle details to the parking lot, including the vehicle type, registration number, and color.
- Remove a vehicle from the parking lot based on the registration number or parking slot number.
- Check the availability of vehicle spaces on a specific floor for a given vehicle type.

## Cost Strategy

The cost strategy is implemented as a flat cost structure based on the vehicle type per hour:
- Bike per hour â‚¹ 10
- Car / Jeep per hour â‚¹ 20
- Bus / Truck per hour â‚¹ 30
